## TELEXYZ (tele see z)

+ TELE-See means an overall view, means seeing the big picture. 

+ See-Z means going deep enough to see through every obstructions until reaching the root of the problem, then the solution emerge.

+ XYZ means everything-related-to, every-aspects-of the problem.

+ XYZ commonly known as 3D coordinate system, means we aproach the problem in a systematical, visualizable, mathematical way!


=>

* TELE-XYZ means seeing everything, every aspects of the problem and seeing deeper and deeper to reach the root of the problem. Seeing how everything related in a systematical, visualizable, mathematical way! Then from that seeing, we know intutively / instinctively how to put things together as a whole (nicely fitable and work well with others). And that a whole is the natual solution we and others are looking for.

[ IMPORTANT ] The solution is already existed, it's fixed, it's unchange, it's univeral, and it's the ONE. The problem itself is not the problem (since the solution is already there). The real problem is our understanding about the problem. We don't solve the problem, we solved ourselve day-by-day in a humble KNOW-NOTHING, UNDERTAND-NOTHING approach:

+ Always try to understand problem and it's context and related-things deeper and deeper and more coherent (dính liền, cố kết, mạch lạc, chặt chẽ). See them closer, clearer and in more angles.

+ Developer our understanding (of the problem) organically by asking questions. And we must try very hard to ask the RIGHT question!

+ The RIGHT question is the one that make us clear, make us focus, make us light since it put unrelevant questions, unrelated concerns out of our mind.

+ We may never reach the true understanding of the problem. We don't know everything, we just know a tiny piece of universal truth. We don't know that there are a lot of things out there exist out of our awareness. So we (always) make assumptions about how things works based-on that tiny picece of truth that we known. Those assumptions could be right but mostly are wrong. Our jobs is pushing hard and trying everything we can to validate our assumptions!

+ Build momentum by accumulate data knowledges, insights, experiences via trial-and-errors (of ours and others: we live in the Internet and open source world) until BOOM everything is become clear and they form the solution themselve.

Note: We don't build product to solve problem. We build product to VALIATE our understanding about the problem. We don't fix the product, we fix our understanding about the problem. We don't fix bug by testing the program, we correct our intentions and making sure the machine understand our intentions correctly by testings. A lot of tests, unit-tests, functional-tests, integration-tests ... and make sure our test case cover every aspect of the problem domain as much as possible. In that point of view, EDGE CASES are really MATTER!

But, hey, you should go down the rabbit hole with me by reading [ >>> HERE I SHOULD BE, DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE <<< ] section (seach below). That where we are stuck and I am pushing hard. Giving a cheer or a little help will help to gain momentum a little-by-little until we can get out of it.

Definition of rabbit hole: a complexly bizarre or difficult state or situation conceived of as a hole into which one falls or descends. Especially: one in which the pursuit of something (such as an answer or solution) leads to other questions, problems, or pursuits.
