“Today, NLP technology is becoming an indispensable part of our business and daily lives. For example, search engines automatically process trillions of documents over the Internet”

“Online retailers process millions of product descriptions and user comments, for recommending the most suitable product given a user search. Automatic dialogue systems and translation systems are being increasingly widely used to facilitate communication. 

In business, text analytics engines have been replacing manual labour in analysing huge amounts of documents for better decision making. 

<Such progress has been largely driven by advances in machine learning techniques, which contribute to fundamental algorithms and foundational models of NLP>. 

This book introduces these techniques, starting from the most elementary models based on counting relative frequencies, moving incrementally towards more advanced techniques such as discriminative structural models, probabilistic graph models and deep neural networks. In this chapter, we introduce NLP and NLP tasks, explaining why it is beneficial to learn NLP from a machine learning perspective.”


## What is NLP?

“In the broadest sense, NLP refers to the study of automatically processing or synthesising human languages. This can range from simple string pattern matching algorithms using regular expressions to sophisticated intelligent systems using artificial neural networks to translate between different languages. NLP is an inter-disciplinary research area. Some work falls between linguistics and computer science, investigating computational methods to model languages and to address linguistic questions. Some work originates from an artificial intelligence perspective, aiming to equip intelligent systems with human language capabilities. Some work is more data-science oriented, considering the automatic processing of large-scale text data in order to extract useful structured knowledge. Some work is also related to psychology, cognitive science and neural science.”


## NLP from a Machine Learning Perspective

Although there is a plethora of NLP tasks in the linguistic or application perspective, NLP tasks can be categorised into much fewer types when viewed from a machine learning perspective. 

For example, the tasks of POS-tagging, syntactic chunking, word segmentation, supertagging, named entity recognition, targeted sentiment classification can all be seen as the same task in machine learning, solved using the same principled method, 


“While it is highly interesting to consider clever ways of casting linguistic problems into mathematical forms, FOR MOST OF THE TASKS discussed in Section 1.2 A SMALL SET OF LINGUISTIC KNOWLEDGE CAN BE SUFFICIENT FOR BUILDING A COMPETITIVE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL. In fact, a **computational linguist** who does not speak Bahasa can build a state-of-the-art syntactic parser for the language! 

.. the NLP field has been driven by the development of methods rather than tasks. In fact, a technical advance typically leads to improvements over a range of NLP tasks. Hence we center around methods for the remainder of this book, describing tasks of the same nature together.”
